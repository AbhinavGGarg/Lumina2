# Lumina — Autonomous Penetration Testing Platform

Lumina is an AI-orchestrated penetration testing platform that combines a LangGraph state machine, industry-standard security tooling, and LLM interpretation into a single automated pipeline. Point it at a web target or a local repository and it will fingerprint the stack, dynamically select the relevant scanners, interpret raw tool output with an LLM, build an attack chain graph, and deliver a structured vulnerability report — all streamed live to the UI.

## How it works

A **planner node** inspects the target first:

- **URL targets** — runs a quick pre-scan fingerprint (httpx + whatweb) and uses LLM-driven adaptive planning to select relevant web agents. Under uncertain signal (timeouts/connection issues/localhost), guardrails keep a safe baseline of recon + SQL injection + XSS before attack chain + report.
- **Repository targets** — walks the file tree, builds a fingerprint, and asks the LLM to choose only the relevant agents from: `static_c`, `static`, `deps_py`, `deps_js`, `secrets`.

Each selected **agent node** runs its toolset, skips the LLM call if the tools fail to produce output, and accumulates structured findings into shared graph state. After all scan agents complete, an **attack chain node** reasons over the combined findings to produce a causal MITRE-aligned exploit graph. A final **report node** synthesises everything into a Markdown vulnerability report.

LLM token streaming is pushed to the frontend in real time via SSE throughout every node.

| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Planner               | LLM + file-tree fingerprint  | both        |

## LLM providers

Set `LLM_PROVIDER` in your environment to switch backends:

| Provider           | Env var           | Default model       |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| `ollama` (default) | `OLLAMA_MODEL`    | `llama3.1:8b`       |
| `openai`           | `OPENAI_MODEL`    | `gpt-4o`            |
| `claude`           | `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |

For OpenAI-compatible providers (including Featherless), also set:

- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (example: `https://api.featherless.ai/v1`)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- optional: `OPENAI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `12`)

## Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** — runs the backend and all security binaries inside Linux containers
- **pnpm** — runs the Next.js frontend natively
- **Ollama** (if using the default local LLM) — must be running on your host machine. On macOS, run `launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"` before starting Ollama so the backend container can reach it via `host.docker.internal`.

## Quick start (development)

The development setup runs the backend inside Docker (for the security tools) and the frontend natively (for fast hot-reload). Your local Ollama instance is used for LLM inference.

### 1. Start the backend and test target

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
- OWASP Juice Shop test target: `http://localhost:3001`

The backend volume-mounts `./backend` so Python code changes hot-reload without a rebuild. If you change environment variables, prompts, or the Dockerfile, restart the container:

```bash
docker restart lumina-dev-backend
```

### 2. Start the frontend

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

## Hosted frontend setup (Vercel/Netlify)

If the frontend is deployed separately from the backend, configure one of these:

- `BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain` (recommended; built-in `/api/*` proxy), or
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain` (direct browser calls)
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain` on the backend (required for direct browser calls)

Without one of these, scan requests from the deployed UI will fail.

### No-pay quick fix (works today)

If you do not want paid APIs/hosting, run backend locally and expose it with a free tunnel:

1. Start backend locally
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```
2. Expose backend with a free tunnel (Cloudflare)
```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```
3. Copy tunnel URL and set Vercel env:
```bash
BACKEND_API_URL=https://<your-tunnel-url>
```
4. Redeploy frontend.

## Scanning targets

**Web target (Juice Shop):**
Because the backend runs inside Docker's network, use the container alias rather than `localhost`:

```
http://host.docker.internal:3001
```

**Public GitHub repository:**
Submit a repository root URL directly:

```
https://github.com/owner/repository
```

Lumina clones the repository inside the backend container runtime (named Docker
volume mounted at `/var/lumina/repos`) and scans that snapshot. Nothing is
cloned into your local workspace.

**Local repository:**
Mount the repo into `/tmp` on your host and submit the container-side path:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/your/repo /tmp/myrepo
# Submit: /tmp/myrepo
```

The dev compose file mounts `/tmp` and `/Users` read-only into the backend container.

### Default allowlisted public examples

Out-of-the-box allowlist includes:

- `example.com`
- `scanme.nmap.org`
- `testphp.vulnweb.com` (demo target with likely findings)

By default, Lumina now accepts any valid `http(s)` URL target.
To re-enable strict host allowlisting, set:

```bash
ENFORCE_TARGET_ALLOWLIST=true
ALLOWED_TARGETS=example.com,scanme.nmap.org,testphp.vulnweb.com
```

## Featherless AI setup

Use Featherless as an OpenAI-compatible backend by setting:

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.featherless.ai/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-featherless-key>
OPENAI_MODEL=<your-featherless-model>
```

## Useful Docker commands

```bash
# Stream backend logs
docker logs lumina-dev-backend -f

# Restart backend (after env/prompt changes)
docker restart lumina-dev-backend

# Stop everything
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## Full stack (all-in-Docker, including Ollama and frontend)

For a fully containerised deployment (no local dependencies):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This spins up Ollama, the backend, the Next.js frontend, and Juice Shop all within a shared Docker network.
